## Team Presentation

### 1. Jim Penner
Hi, I live in Brisbane Australia and am originally from western Canada:  Calgary.  Relatively new to Computer Science and coding, I have run a financial advisory firm for 22+ years and began 3 years ago working with some colleagues on a FinTech offering.  My skills are more organisational and leadership, and yet I have been able to get some fintech and other computing/coding knowledge over the past 3-4 years.  Looking forward to the collaboration, and Happy Mothers Day to any Mom's in the group!

### 2. Shenxiao(Sherry) Li
Hi. Team 1. This is Shenxiao. You can also call me Sherry. I have been working as a financial analyst for past few years and now finishing my CS degree here in BU.  I'm excited to collaborate  and learn from you  all in building a cool Springboots project.

### 3. Chaozheng Zhu
`This is Chaozheng from SanFrancisco,nice to meet everyone and we can work together for a micro service project `

### 4. Hunter Washburne
I am a former Shakespearean actor who is transitioning into a life of coding and tech in the wake of the pandemic. I currently work in a toystore in Dallas, and will graduate from BU with a CS degree as soon as I finish my last two classes.

### 5. Jordany Arnaud
Hi, I currently reside in Orlando, FL, but I am originally from Haiti. This class is the final step to completing my MS in Software Development Program. I have been working as a Software developer for about  9 years. I am excited to collaborate with all of you , especially the members of Team 1.
